## WeBook Application
A platform that connects aspiring writers with their peers and bookworms to progressively work on perfecting their craft.

## Motivation
As an aspiring writer, wouldn’t you want to share your creativity with the rest of the world and receive immediate constructive feedback?
There are many authors out there that it is hard to compete with for eyeballs and there is a long process of getting your work out there to share with people. While you are still perfecting your craft, why not share it with people that are like yourself and book lovers to help you write better.
A platform that connects you with your fellow peers in the writing community and to your future audience. This application would help you test the waters and gain inspiration to write even more.
As a book lover, wouldn’t you want to explore new content to read? 
There are so many popular books out there but those that we are exposed to are typically written by renowned authors. How about those that you don’t know about? Looking for fresh new content and wanting to discover books that are unique and written by inspiring writers. 
This application would allow you to read and comment on these fresh new content. Who knows? You can help a future writer on their path to a published book.

## The Need
Based on several bestselling authors like Jerry Jenkins, for writers who are trying to start a writing career. The advice given to them was to polish their craft, writing things shorter than a book and immersing themselves in a community of writers to feedback upon. Hence, this app would like to serve these writers who aspire to be an author.

## Aim
We hope to make an efficient social media platform that aims to connect writers to share and improve one another’s work. At the same time, introducing their work to bookworms to gather some reputation.
